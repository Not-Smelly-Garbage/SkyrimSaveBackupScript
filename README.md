# Installation:
Put both files in
\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Saves

# What it does:

- It runs [SKSE Co-Save Cleaner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17377) at the beginning, deleting excess skse co-saves.
- It creates a "backup" folder along with "old" inside of it.
- It copies the 6 newest saves  to the "backup" folder.
- It deletes old saves the "old" folder.
- It moves existing saves from the "backup" folder to the "old" folder.
*** - It then deletes the oldest saves until only the 6 newest remain in the main folder.***


To disable that last bit just delete the last chunk, its all anotated.
You could also change the max save numbers and whatnot to whatever, I just keep it lower
